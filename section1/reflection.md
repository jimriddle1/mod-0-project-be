## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
\
I tend not to ask the questions, at least not right away out of pride.  Need to work on this.  

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
```
puts "Hello world!"
```

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
\
"#"

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float? \
Integer is for round numbers, floats can have decimal places

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
```
animal = "Zebra"
```

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
```
puts animal
```

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`. 


Interpolation adds variables within a string.  It is useful when you want to get some input from a user, and use that in the output.
```
puts "My favorite animal is #{animal}"
```

8. What method is used to get input from a user?
```
gets.chomp is an example
```

9. Name and describe two common string methods:

.length and .sub seem pretty common
