# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Jim Riddle"
puts name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
puts house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
message = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
puts message



# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
students = students + 2
puts students

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
# YOUR CODE HERE
students = students - 2
puts students


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.

first_name = "Jim"
is_hungry = false
number_of_pets = 0

# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?

# Explain.
# Names will almost always be strings, I can either only be hungry or not hungry, and the number of pets I have is an integer (can't have half a pet, or at least you shouldn't)


# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to
# different values (but same data type).
# Print all three variables to the terminal.

first_name = "Ronald"
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = 45

puts "His name is #{first_name}, Is he hungry? #{is_hungry} and he has #{number_of_pets} many pets"


# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

puts healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks


#-------------------
# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out
# to the terminal as you would expect?

#didn't realize i had to not make booleans capatilizied.  FALSE did not work, but false did
