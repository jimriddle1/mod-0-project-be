## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
```some people think it's all nature and no nurture, but if you want to grow you can grow.  
learning can come in all shapes and sizes, and failing / retrying things, is a good way to learn
```

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
```
I like to experiment.  I don't mind getting things wrong.
One way that I do not is that if I "think" I get a concept, i tend to half ass the rest of the problem.  learning by repititon is a powerful thing.
```

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
```a condtional statement is the programming doing one or multiple different things based on the evaluation of a statment.
example 1 - if it is rainy, bring a coat, if it isn't, don't bring a coat.
example 2 - if i am rich, donate, if i am super rich, become less rich, otherwise, get back on that grind
example 3 - if i smell bad, go ahead and shower my man, otherwise, you are ready to hit the tizzown
```

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
We would use an if statement if we want to have the user give input

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
if variable equals xxx, do this (note this does not include nested ifs, or else statements)

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
you can use either the and (&&) or the or (||) to have multiple conditions in an if statement

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
```
if weather == sunny
  puts "Go ahead and take that sunscreen"
elsif weather == rainy
  puts "Go ahead and take that umbrella"
else
  puts "might just want to stay inside my man"
end

```
